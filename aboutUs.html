		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>BOOM!’s straightforward approach to its About page works. Why? Because it’s designed for conversions. It clearly states who its product is designed for, what it values, and how the brand got started by solving a problem for aging women.

The biggest takeaway from BOOM!’s approach is that it sets a See Our Products CTA high on the page. It’s safe to assume this approach does a solid job of sending shoppers to its product pages. 

Like BOOM!, try experimenting with your CTA. There’s no hard rule that says your CTA needs to live at the bottom of your About page. Consider placing it near the top as part of your introduction. Have it stand out by ensuring your call to action is hard to miss.
